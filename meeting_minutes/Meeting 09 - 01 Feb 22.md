# Meeting 9 - 01 Feb 22

## 1. Progress Update

- Koray has completed the react scaffold including routing
- Koray has successfully completed a deployment to netlify.
- Leigh has completed most of initial rails setup of database and models.

## 2. Testing

- Agreed that testing should be implemented early and in parallel with developing code.
- Can start to test react components.  API tests can be implemented when API routes/controllers in place.
- Need to ascertain best testing strategy for rails components.

## 3. Next Steps

- Koray will look at styling to ensure the design is responsive. Potentially using bootstrap.
- Leigh will continue with the rails initial database and models setup
- Once initial setup is complete, we will be able to determine further tasks and plan to divide between us so that we both get to work on front-end and back-end apps, continuing our branching code review source code methodology from part A.

## 4. Blockers

- None

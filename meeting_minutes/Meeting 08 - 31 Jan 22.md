# Meeting 8 - 31 Jan 22

## 1. Progress Update

- Part A is complete and submitted by both Koray and Leigh.

## 2. Planning Part B

- Discussion of how to start implementing the project, including methodology of task allocation.
- Initial tasks are to build the rails and react project scaffolds.
- Because Leigh has done the ERD, he will continue by implementing this into a Rails app.
- Koray will therefore build the initial react app.
- Decided to following agile principles implementing a feature at a time, and break the feature into small pieces using BDD style tasks on the Trello board
- Tasks can therefore be self allocated from the Trello board once the behaviour of a feature is defined.

## 3. Deploy early deploy often

- In line with best practice, we plan to do the first deployment of both back-end and front end  as soon as both apps are set up.

## 4. Next Steps

- Koray will scaffold the front-end react app and start to build different pages linked by a router.
- Leigh will scaffold the back-end rails app, add models and relationships, routes, controllers.
- Deployment of both when a working app is ready.

## 5. Progress Target

- Agreed that given the project time of 14 days, we should attempt to have the MVP completed well in advance of the due date.
- Specific target of a working, unstyled MVP by Friday 4th February 2022
- Will therefore have ample time to consider priority 1 extra features, such as bookings, payment gateway etc.
- Also ample time for styling
- Continuous deployment will ensure no last minute crises on last day of project.

## 6. Blockers

- None

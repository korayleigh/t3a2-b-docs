# Meeting 15 - 09 Feb 22

## 1. Progress Update

- Koray has completed AWS S3 image upload
- Koray has completed the main menu page with a responsive design of cards
- Leigh has completed the Order Details UI and ability to edit Order Items in a modal.


## 2. Testing vs Styling

- Based on feedback from today's presentation and considering personal commitments in the lead up to due date, we discussed prioritising a few visual sprinkles like:
  - A Mexican colour theme
  - A favicon
  - A footer
  - A logo?

- Koray will revisit the rubric to analyse the cost/benefit of achieving 90% code coverage, in the available time, vs other more visual features and functionality that will be valuable in a portfolio piece

## 3. Next Steps

- Koray will work on the menu detail modal that appears after clicking on a menu card.
- Koray will look into cart functionality with a package 'react-use-cart'
- Leigh will look into authorisation framework CanCanCan for rails.
- Leigh will try and work out how to display a price as a fixed decimal, when it is stored as a integer of cents.

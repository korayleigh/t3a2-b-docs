# Meeting 10 - 02 Feb 22

## 1. Progress Update

- Koray has completed bootstrap setup and deployment including responsive navbar
- Leigh has completed the remaining rails setup of database and models.
- Leigh has added seed data to the rails db.
- Leigh has revised the ERD.

## 2. Task Management and Planning

- Agreed that it would be ideal to have most tasks on the board ready to go in small chunks so that either of us can just take a task and start working at any time
- In order to do so, we need to first identify what tasks we need to do
- We agreed to do this based on user stories rather than features as the additional detail should help with fleshing out specific application implementation requirements.

## 3. Authentication, Devise, and JWT Token on Rails

- Agreed that would be good to prioritise implementation / testing of devise features to confirm that the employees/user models work as expected.
- Discussed that implementing JWT with rails is something that needs clarification/research

## 3. Next Steps

- Leigh will look into JWT with rails
- Koray will add the user stories into the backlog, and add checklist tasks to begin breaking down into implementation steps.
- We will reconvene once this has been completed to assess next steps.

## 5. Blockers

- None
